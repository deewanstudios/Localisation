          <p> The Small Business Delivery Company has provided Elephant Family with an inordinate amount of help over the last year. The logistics involved in transporting hundreds of pieces of fragile art and sculptures all safely around London and Edinburgh is a massive worry for us, but they have never let us down in any way. The SBDC will go out of their way to ensure your delivery arrives safely and on time...<br>
and the friendly, professional manner helps too.            <em>Joe Innes, Logistics Officer - Elephant Family</em></p>

          <p> Our thanks go to the Small Business Delivery Company. We recently moved offices but couldn't afford to be 'out of action' - we couldn't have asked for a better service from SBDC. The move was completed in three hours, they went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure it all went smoothly. The price is fantastic, particularly when we demanded flexibility on number of trips and timing.            <em>Kate Bretherton, Chief Operations Officer, Consortium for Street Children </em></p>

          <p> In 2012, Matt Kent and his team delivered trees across London for The Christmas Forest for the second year running. <br>

They are a brilliantly well organised and positive outfit, for whom nothing ever seems to be too much trouble. A pleasure to work with!            <em>Fiona Donald, www.christmasforest.co.uk</em></p>

          <p> The efficiency, reliability and care taken by the Small Business Delivery Company to transport numerous amounts of delicate art work for exhibitions for Anti-Slavery International was invaluable to the success of the events. With excellent rates, outstanding customer service, we could not have been happier with SBDC. Would definitely recommend giving them a call.            <em>Rachel Marcuzzi, Events Fundraising Consultant - Anti-Slavery International.</em></p>
